            <h2>Lore</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Gul'dan was the first orcish warlock as well as the de facto founder of the Horde. He betrayed both his
                people and his mentor Ner'zhul to the demon lord Kil'jaeden for personal gain and power, and was
                directly responsible for the orcs' fall to demonic enslavement and their subsequent invasion of Azeroth.
                Tutored by the leaders of the Burning Legion, he is considered one of the most powerful warlocks to have
                ever existed. He founded the Shadow Council and created the first death knights. Gul'dan often
                referred to himself as "Darkness Incarnate" and "The Destroyer of Dreams."
                <br><br>
                Gul'dan was born crippled, weak and deformed in a village in Gorgrond. His condition made him a
                target for constant mockery and abuse, for which he hated his clan. When the others finally tried to
                beat him to death to be rid of him, the clan's shaman stopped them and told Gul'dan that he saw
                greatness in him, advising him to go to the Throne of the Elements to seek his destiny. Gul'dan angrily
                rejected the shaman, and the chieftain banished Gul'dan from the village.
                <br><br>
                The bitterness that had sustained him all his life ate at him until nothing was left. After months of
                starvation and wandering alone through the wastes, Gul'dan began to consider that the safety of a clan
                might be better than endless suffering. He finally heeded the old shaman's words and, dragging himself
                to the Throne of the Elements, offered himself in the service of whatever would end his anguish. The
                spirits of fire, earth, water, and air approached him but, sensing the darkness and fury within the
                orc's heart, violently recoiled from him. However, in the absence of the furies, Kil'jaeden
                began to whisper to him. The demon lord offered Gul'dan power in return for becoming the harbinger of
                his fury.
                <br><br>
                Kil'jaeden needed a public figure to unite the orcs against the draenei, but Gul'dan could not inspire
                or lead his people by example. Kil'jaeden ordered him to ally with someone who could, but first he would
                need to eliminate everyone who knew of his past. Gul'dan returned to his village, draped in tattered
                robes. When the chieftain furiously reminded Gul'dan that he was never allowed to return to his people,
                Gul'dan roared that he had no people and obliterated the chieftain with fel energy. Gul'dan then went on
                a rampage, killing all of his former brethren. As the village burned, Gul'dan spotted the village shaman
                - the only source of any relative kindness in his life. Gul'dan earnestly thanked the shaman, saying
                that he had found his destiny, then killed him as well. Claiming the shaman's staff and a ring, Gul'dan
                left the burning ruins of his birthplace behind forever. Its name and existence would be lost to history
                - just as the vengeful Gul'dan preferred.
                <br><br>
                Careful to hide his fel powers, Gul'dan approached the Shadowmoon clan, whose shaman commanded respect
                from all orcs, perfect for Kil'jaeden's plan. He told them that his village had been destroyed by ogres
                and he was the only survivor. Orcs accepting newcomers into clans was uncommon, but the Shadowmoon took
                pity on Gul'dan and did just that. Gul'dan carefully observed the clan's shaman for one that would work,
                and eventually settled on the chieftain Ner'zhul. He was dedicated, forthright, and persistent, but also
                held turmoil and sorrow because of the death of his mate Rulkan and the recent trouble with elemental
                spirits. Gul'dan preyed on Ner'zhul's inner darkness. He told the chieftain of his own troubles, of the
                family and friends he had lost at his village, and in time befriended him, and convinced him to take him
                on as an, unbeknownst to him, pretend shaman apprentice. Through Gul'dan, Kil'jaeden now had access to a
                public figure. As the demon began to manipulate Ner'zhul, he tasked Gul'dan with making the orcs see the
                draenei as enemies. Gul'dan was present at the Kosh'harg celebration in Nagrand.
                <br><br>
                As Ner'zhul rallied the orcs for a war against the draenei at the behest of a powerful ancestor referred
                to as "The Beautiful One" (in truth, Kil'jaeden in disguise), Gul'dan supported Ner'zhul fully. However,
                when Ner'zhul began to notice that they could no longer call upon the power of the elements or the
                ancestors, the shaman began to sense something was amiss. He discovered at Oshu'gun that he had been
                duped by Kil'jaeden and attempted to back out. To Ner'zhul's horror, he discovered that Gul'dan had seen
                everything at Oshu'gun and told Kil'jaeden of it all before Ner'zhul returned.
                <br><br>
                As a necessity of his bid for power, Gul'dan trained a number of like-minded and powerful orcs, whom he
                named the Shadow Council. The Council was soon using its power and influence to direct almost every
                aspect of orc society, so as to distract those few who opposed his dark ideals from their true masters,
                Gul'dan and Kil'jaeden. He opened schools of demonology and necromancy to teach shamans new power to
                replace their lost connections to the elements, transforming them into necrolytes and warlocks. To seal
                the bargain between him and Kil'jaeden, Gul'dan and the Shadow Council offered the clan chieftains the
                Blood of Mannoroth. The first chieftain to accept his gift was Grommash Hellscream, with majority of the
                remaining following suit right after. The resulting Horde was bloodthirsty, barbaric, and evil, an
                extension of the demons whom they now worshiped.
                <br><br>
                While creating the Shadow Council Gul'dan would encounter the ogre Cho'gall, who had been forced to flee
                from Highmaul after escaping assassination. Gul'dan became intrigued by Cho'gall's confidence and lust
                for power and made him his foremost apprentice, teaching him fel magic and of the existence of the
                Burning Legion.
                <br><br>
                Another individual Gul'dan encountered was Garona. As a half-orc, half-draenei outcast, Garona had found
                survival to be brutally difficult. She had learned quickly how to avoid unwinnable fights, and how to
                quietly kill relentless pursuers. Gul'dan bound her mind to his will and began to secretly train her in
                the art of assassination. She did not fully understand his intentions, but she grew to resent his
                cruelty. Still, she obeyed. Survival demanded nothing less. Gul'dan had her magically aged and
                tortured. Having also traveled throughout Draenor, Garona was well-versed in the culture of the
                orcs. She quickly became the chief interpreter of the Shadow Council and Gul'dan's personal spy and
                assassin. Per Kil'jaeden's instructions, he also had the Blackrock orcs craft daggers Anguish and Sorrow
                for Garona, which she used to carry out countless atrocities while under Gul'dan's control, including
                the eventual murder of King Llane during the First War.
                <br><br>
                As a test of the Horde's strength, Gul'dan and the Shadow Council guided the orcs into murdering every
                single draenei they could find on their homeworld. The near-extermination of the draenei, a race as old
                as his master Kil'jaeden, proved that the orcs were ready for the next slaughter. He also sent
                Blackheart the Inciter, whom he recruited after taking control of the Horde, and Vorpil with a group of
                orcs to plunder Auchindoun. Gul'dan also manipulated the election of Blackhand as the Horde's new
                warchief, as he was the perfect pawn for the Shadow Council. Though Blackhand was competent in battle
                and a relatively sound tactician, he had a lust for power — and thus was easy for Gul'dan to control.
