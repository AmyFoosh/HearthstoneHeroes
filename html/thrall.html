            <h2>Lore</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Thrall (birthname Go'el), son of Durotan and Draka, is the former Warchief of the restored shamanistic
                Horde, founder of the nation of Durotar in Kalimdor and one of the second wave of shaman. His
                parents killed by Gul'dan's assassins shortly after his birth in the beginning of the First War, he was
                found and raised by Aedelas Blackmoore who gave Thrall his name. Raised as a slave and gladiator, he
                later joined Orgrim Doomhammer in freeing the orcs imprisoned after the Second War, being named Warchief
                after Doomhammer's death. After leading the Horde away from the Alliance-claimed Eastern Kingdoms, he
                rescued and made allies of the Darkspear trolls and Bloodhoof tauren. Thrall led the new Horde against
                their former demonic masters in the Battle of Mount Hyjal. He subsequently led diplomatic efforts at
                peace between the Horde and Alliance after the end of the Third War, as well as accepted new members to
                the Horde, like the Forsaken of the Undercity and the blood elves of Quel'Thalas.
                <br><br>
                After the fall of the Lich King and the increasing elemental unrest heralding the Cataclysm, Thrall
                stepped down as leader of the Horde, appointed Garrosh Hellscream as Warchief, and joined with the
                shamanistic Earthen Ring to combat the rampaging elements, eventually aiding the Aspects in Deathwing's
                downfall.
                <br><br>
                With his victory over the corrupted aspect behind him, Thrall had been forced to deal with the chaos his
                replacement had sown in his wake. The Pandaria Campaign clearly demonstrated Garrosh's unforeseeable
                madness and pride, leading to dissension within the Horde itself. Thrall stepped back in to defend the
                Horde and its allies from their increasingly ruthless dictator. Together with Vol'jin and the other
                disenfranchised leaders of the Horde, Thrall overthrew his ill-fated successor in the Siege of
                Orgrimmar. After Garrosh's capture, Thrall personally chose Vol'jin to hold the Horde together and
                pledged his allegiance to him, along with the remaining leaders of the faction. His mate Aggra also gave
                birth to a son named Durak.
                <br><br>
                During the war in Draenor, Thrall was a key member of the Horde expedition to an alternate version of
                the orcish homeworld Draenor. In addition to aiding in many key battles, he met and befriended his
                parents of that timeline and made allies of the Frostwolf Orcs. Knowing that Garrosh was responsible for
                the events in the alternate Draenor, Thrall pursued him and was ultimately successful in killing Garrosh
                in their final mak'gora.
                <br><br>
                Eventually, the weight of all the wars he had fought began to weigh more heavily upon the former
                warchief and Thrall's own abilities and resolve eventually began to waver. During the Burning Legion's
                latest invasion of Azeroth, he passed both the Doomhammer and the mantle of leader of the Earthen Ring
                down to a shaman adventurer, knowing the future was now in safer hands. With this, he retired with his
                family to Nagrand, where he established a small farm. This did not last, as he was called from
                retirement by Varok Saurfang, who needed his aid in preventing Sylvanas Windrunner, Vol'jin's successor
                after his death during the Legion's invasion, from tearing the Horde apart. Leading a rebellion
                alongside Saurfang, Thrall upheld his promise to Saurfang who perished during a mak'gora with
                Windrunner, who then abandoned the Horde. Taking on a mantle of leadership for his people once again,
                Thrall became a member of the Horde Council, which replaced the warchief position, as the orcish
                representative.
                <br><br>
                After the end of the war, Thrall was captured along other leaders of both factions by the Mawsworn, and
                was sent into the Shadowlands where he was tormented within Torghast. He was eventually rescued by Maw
                Walkers and joined them in their campaign against Zovaal the Jailer and his forces.
                <br><br>
                Go'el is the son of Durotan, former chieftain of the Frostwolf clan, and Draka. He was born in the year
                1 in their new home in the Alterac Mountains. Soon after the birth, Draka and the child accompanied
                Durotan to a secret meeting with Orgrim Doomhammer in Loch Modan. While in Loch Modan, Durotan
                warned Orgrim about the treachery of the warlock Gul'dan and his Shadow Council who used the orcish race
                as vassals to their ambition for power. Soon after, Durotan and his family were escorted by Orgrim's
                personal bodyguards on their way home to the north when in truth, the guards were actually assassins
                loyal to Gul'dan and brutally murdered Durotan and Draka while leaving the infant Go'el to die
                helplessly in the wilderness.
                <br><br>
                Go'el was found amongst the bloody bodies of his murdered parents somewhere in the north of Loch Modan
                by Aedelas Blackmoore, commander of the internment camps which held orcs after the end of the Second
                War. Blackmoore gave him the name Thrall, which was another word for "slave" in the human tongue, which
                would cling to the orc for the remainder of his life. Blackmoore returned to his fortress, Durnholde
                Keep, with Thrall, and raised him as a gladiator — with all the savagery of an orc, but with the keen
                strategic intellect of a human. He was trained and taught by many, wet-nursed by a human woman, and grew
                to befriend her daughter, Taretha Foxton. Thrall proved to be an excellent student and a phenomenal
                fighter. Thrall became a gladiator in Durnholde's arena and Aedelas' source of money. During one
                encounter in the arena, Prince Arthas Menethil visited Durnholde Keep in order to watch Thrall in a
                fight.
                <br><br>
                Thrall's first encounter with other orcs was while training with Sergeant and several trainees at
                Durnholde. A cart of captured orcs was moving through Durnholde at the time, to be kept within the
                camps, and one who saw Thrall believed that (rather than it being a training exercise) he was being
                ganged up on by humans. The orc broke free of his chains and moved to save Thrall, yelling at him in
                Orcish to run away, but at the time, Thrall did not understand any language except Common and so had no
                idea what his would-be savior was shouting. The orc was beaten and killed right before the young
                Thrall's eyes.
                <br><br>
                He was clever, quick and enormous even by orc standards. Blackmoore's abusive beatings both in and out
                of the ring began to take its toll. Taretha began to write him letters and secretly delivered them to
                him in his cage within books, and he wrote back to her. Eventually, he wrote to Taretha that he wished
                to escape, following a series of fights where he fought bravely but did not finish the last round, and
                was consequently physically punished by Aedelas.
                <br><br>
                Taretha created a diversion inside Durnholde Keep which allowed Thrall to escape from his cell
                unnoticed. They met up outside the fortress by a cave, and Taretha gave him provisions and supplies. He
                then left Durnholde, hoping to never return.
                <br><br>
                Thrall was captured and taken to an internment camp run by one Lorin Remka. It was here that he met an
                old orc with glowing red eyes named Kelgar, who told him of the corruption of Gul'dan, and how the old
                ways had been so much better for the Horde. He told him that the only one still thinking of embracing
                this was the undefeated Grom Hellscream, Chieftain of the Warsong clan. When another orc told Thrall
                that Blackmoore had arrived at the camp looking for him, Thrall escaped again and sought out Grom
                Hellscream.
