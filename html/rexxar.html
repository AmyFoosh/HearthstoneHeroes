            <hr>
            <p>
                Rexxar, Champion of the Horde, is a half-ogre, half-orc beastmaster of the Mok'Nathal clan, and may
                be one of the few from the clan. He was instrumental in aiding the Horde during the founding of Durotar,
                and saved the city of Orgrimmar from Admiral Proudmoore. Due to his mixed lineage, he is a towering and
                massively muscled warrior, and he wields his two huge axes with tremendous skill and ferocity. Rexxar is
                always seen with his loyal bear companion Misha.
                <br><br>
                In the period between the founding of Durotar and the reopening of the Dark Portal, Rexxar wandered the
                wilds of Kalimdor, his path running from the Stonetalon Mountains through Desolace to Feralas. During
                the Burning Crusade, he ventured to Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains of Outland,
                protecting the settlement against ogres and gronn while trying to reconnect with his people. He returned
                to Azeroth during the Cataclysm, and later joined the hunters of the Unseen Path during the last war
                with the Burning Legion. After the Legion was defeated, Rexxar served on the front lines in Kul Tiras,
                and later answered Varok Saurfang's call to arms in the uprising that deposed Warchief Sylvanas
                Windrunner.
                <br><br>
                Rexxar was one of the Horde warriors, a fruit from the union between orcs and ogres. Rexxar was
                originally part of the pacifist mok'nathal, based on Draenor in Gorgrond, under the watchful guard of
                his father, Leoroxx. Unwelcome by both the full-blooded orcs and ogres in the area, the Mok'Nathal were
                secular and isolationist, wishing little else but to be left to their own devices. But their pacifist
                ways gave him no reason to stay, and in addition, Rexxar believed the Horde could help the mok'nathal
                find water and food. However, in time Rexxar would learn the Horde's purpose was not noble
                <br><br>
                After the fall of Shattrath City and the draenei, Warchief Blackhand considered annihilating the
                mok'nathal but stayed his hand. Rexxar convinced Blackhand to spare his people. Rexxar left through
                the Dark Portal during the First War. The beastmaster was accompanied by a large black wolf, Haratha,
                his loyal companion. Rexxar fought in several battles, including the last one in the Black Morass
                Warsong Rexxar full.
                <br><br>
                Rexxar and the Warsong guarding the Dark Portal during the Invasion of Draenor.
                <br><br>
                After the Horde's defeat in the Second War, Rexxar briefly returned to Draenor. When Ner'zhul launched
                his own invasion of Azeroth to retrieve certain artifacts, Rexxar was stationed with Grom Hellscream and
                the Warsong clan on the Azerothian side of the Dark Portal. He remained in the Horde's service until
                just after the destruction of Draenor and the second destruction of the Dark Portal. Rexxar grew
                sickened by the senseless killing that the orcish race seemed to favor, and particularly the constant
                betrayals — first by Gul'dan and then by Ner'zhul. His resolve was further weakened when Haratha was
                drained of its life essences by an orcish warlock when the wolf lept in front of the warlock's spell to
                protect his master. Rexxar slew the warlock but had lost his companion. He followed Grom Hellscream and
                his band of survivors through the Dark Portal to Azeroth, and when discussions started on what to do
                next Rexxar proposed to live a peaceful life in a small piece of land where the Alliance would never
                find them. Grom stated that orcs are supposed to conquer, and he was never willing to leave the Alliance
                in peace. Enraged, Rexxar declared that he would only trust beasts from thereon out, and left the Horde
                to wander the world on which he was now stranded
                <br><br>
                Through his journeys in the wilderness, he came to befriend a bear named Misha, who would come whenever
                summoned by Rexxar. Together, they traveled to Kalimdor, where they roamed the Barrens away from
                civilization. But his journeys had seen nothing but wars amongst the so-called "civilized" creatures.
                <br><br>
                Upon one of his journeys, however, he encountered Mogrin, an orc warrior who came under attack by a
                group of quilboars. Rexxar tried to help the orc, but the quilboar struck a fatal blow, and the warrior
                fell. In his last wish, Mogrin asked Rexxar to deliver a message to Thrall, the orc Warchief, in the
                city of Orgrimmar and to keep Mogrin's death an honorable one. Rexxar agreed and made the journey to
                Orgrimmar.
                <br><br>
                When he arrived, he found Thrall and delivered the message, and Thrall invited him to stay a while,
                mentioning that this land was as much Rexxar's as it was his own. Insisting to earn his keep, Rexxar
                volunteered to help out around the city. He visited Drek'Thar, Nazgrel, and Gazlowe, who commissioned
                him to retrieve Inv misc herb 04 [Shimmerweed] from Thunder Ridge, kill the harpy queen Bloodfeather,
                and collapse the Kobold Mining Columns, respectively. He also received the help of Rokhan.
                <br><br>
                He also encountered on his journeys a jovial brewmaster from the Wandering Isle named Chen Stormstout
                and killed a powerful kobold named Noggrin Onetooth. He helped an orc shaman named Morg Wolfsong regain
                his honor by killing the orc warlocks who had killed his party.
                <br><br>
                After he had helped out Thrall's friends, Rexxar was sent to Gar'thok's outpost where the orc surveyed
                the coast for activity. Rexxar fought his way to the observatory nearby and found a suspicious amount of
                human activity along the coast. Rexxar reported his findings to Thrall, who then sent Nazgrel with
                Rexxar back to Gar'thok's outpost.
                <br><br>
                Rexxar made a short detour to meet Drek'Thar at Thunder Ridge where the far seer found the thunder
                lizards driven mad. Upon further investigation, they found a human lumber mill where many trees had been
                harvested. Rexxar was ready to destroy the mill, but Drek'Thar forbade it, citing a non-aggression
                treaty with the humans. Rexxar was forced to put the maddened thunder lizards down before they caused
                any more harm.
                <br><br>
                Upon arrival at Gar'thok's outpost, Nazgrel and Rexxar found it razed by the humans, and so followed the
                trail of blood back to a human camp on the coast. Immediately hostile, Rexxar threw all treaties aside
                and destroyed the camp and then returned to report to Thrall.
                <br><br>
                Thrall was amazed at the audacity of these humans and questioned Jaina's involvement. Rokhan was
                worried, however, that the humans may strike at the Echo Isles where his people had settled. Rexxar,
                Rokhan, and their allies traveled by zeppelin to the Echo Isles where they found that the Darkspear
                tribe had already come under attack.
                <br><br>
                Their leader, Vol'jin, briefly transformed Rexxar, Chen, and Rokhan into spirit wyverns so that they
                could assist the bat riders in destroying the battleships assaulting the coastal villages. Upon return,
                Vol'jin sent Rexxar to light signal pyres telling the trolls to head for the mainland. These were
                guarded by the lord of the sea giants known as the Sea King.
                <br><br>
                Rexxar returned to Thrall, where the Warchief had received a summons to a peace summit with Jaina, but
                Rexxar didn't trust the humans and volunteered to go in his place. When he arrived at the summit, he
                found an ambush waiting and no sight of Jaina.
                <br><br>
                Thrall suspected that deceit was afoot and prepared a letter for Jaina in the hopes of mending the
                problem, then sent Rexxar to meet with her on Theramore Island. Rexxar and his party asked Samuro, a
                blademaster, to plant explosives to distract the guards of the human coastal settlement on Dustwallow
                Marsh long enough for Rexxar to slip by. However, Samuro remembered his previous mission to eliminate an
                enraged wildkin named Bloodbeak who was hiding nearby, and thus had to complete it before going for the
                humans. Rexxar then met with Jaina, who denied any knowledge of this force and condemned any attack on
                Thrall. She demanded to see these soldiers for herself.
                <br><br>
                Rexxar brought Jaina back to the camp only to find it destroyed by the naga. Rexxar and Jaina fought
                through the force of snake-people looking for any survivors. After finally defeating the naga, led by
                the naga sea witch Lady Darkscale and her guard Scilla Murkshadow, they found a single human footman
                dying who said that the "Admiral" would be pleased to see Jaina safe.
