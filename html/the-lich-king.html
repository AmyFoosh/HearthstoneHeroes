            <h2>Lore</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The Lich King was the master and lord of the Scourge which he ruled telepathically through the Helm of
                Domination from his Frozen Throne atop Icecrown Citadel.
                <br><br>
                Kil'jaeden the Deceiver created the original Lich King from the spirit of the orc shaman Ner'zhul for
                the purpose of raising an undead army to weaken Azeroth in preparation for the Burning Legion's
                invasion. Initially trapped within the Frozen Throne with Frostmourne, the Lich King eventually betrayed
                Kil'jaeden and merged with the human Arthas Menethil. At the climax of the war for Northrend, Arthas the
                Lich King was defeated by Highlord Tirion Fordring and his champions. After the destruction of
                Frostmourne and the death of Arthas, Bolvar Fordragon became the new Lich King in order to keep the
                undead Scourge in check. Bolvar was later defeated by Sylvanas Windrunner who also destroyed the Helm of
                Domination, making the position of Lich King come to an end.
                <br><br>
                At some point, the Jailer had the Runecarver craft both the Helm of Domination and Frostmourne, powerful
                artifacts which would end up in the hands of the Burning Legion.
                <br><br>
                When Ner'zhul attempted to escape Draenor, he was immediately apprehended by the demon lord Kil'jaeden.
                Kil'jaeden tore the old shaman's body apart, but kept his spirit intact and aware. Ner'zhul begged for
                death, but Kil'jaeden said he still had a purpose to serve. He offered Ner'zhul one last chance to serve
                the Burning Legion or face eternal torment. When the orc recklessly agreed, Kil'jaeden encased his
                spirit in a block of diamond-hard ice from the distant reaches of the Twisting Nether. Encased within
                the frozen cask and warped by the demon lord's chaotic powers, Ner'zhul felt his consciousness expand
                ten thousand-fold and he became a spectral being of unfathomable power: the Lich King. The new being
                was sent to Azeroth with the Helm of Domination and Frostmourne merged with his icy tomb.
                <br><br>
                The Lich King was sent to Azeroth through the Great Dark Beyond, landing in Northrend where the ice that
                encased him formed into the shape of a throne. Here, he would begin the formation of the Undead Scourge
                and in the process weaken the world in preparation for the Burning Legion. This new army would not fall
                victim to the petty infighting that had caused the orcs to fail in conquering Azeroth earlier. Sent to
                watch over him were the dreadlords, led by Tichondrius himself. Within the Frozen Throne, the Lich King
                experimented with his psychic powers and enslaved the local indigenous life forms. The plague of undeath
                that came from the Frozen Throne transformed each of them into his undead servants. Thus, using his
                psychic and necromantic powers, he was able to conquer much of Northrend. As he devoured more and more
                souls, he only grew in power as the individual undead under his control gave him "much needed
                nourishment". Thus, his powers began growing at an exponential rate; a fact that the dreadlords were
                well aware of.
                <br><br>
                The Lich King entered a war with the kingdom of Azjol-Nerub, whose ancient inhabitants were immune to
                his plague of undeath. The 10-year conflict known as the War of the Spider ultimately ended with the
                Lich King's first major triumph (while the nerubians were immune to the plague, their corpses could
                still be reanimated). The Lich King was impressed by his enemy, however, and adopted nerubian
                architecture for his own, as a testament to the spider lords' tenacity and age.
                <br><br>
                Having by now established control over most of Northrend, the dreadlords urged Ner'zhul to proceed with
                the agreed-upon plan to prepare the world for the invasion of the Burning Legion.

                The Lich King then used his telepathy to reach out into Azeroth and summon any dark soul that would hear
                his call, focusing on masters of the arcane. Kel'Thuzad, a mage and a prominent member of Dalaran's
                Kirin Tor, answered his call. Kel'Thuzad was soon ensnared by the Lich King, faithfully serving him as
                the first of a "Cult of the Damned"; a cult that would worship the Lich King as a god and be taught
                necromancy to better aid their undead armies.
                <br><br>
                Kel'Thuzad and the dreadlord Mal'Ganis were instructed to begin paving the way, but Ner'zhul, ever
                mindful of Kil'jaeden's schemes, secretly sought a way out of his prison...
                <br><br>
                After preparing for many long months, Kel'Thuzad and his Cult of the Damned finally struck the first
                blow by releasing the plague upon Lordaeron. Prince Arthas Menethil and Lady Jaina Proudmoore along with
                captain Falric began Lordaeron's search for answers on the new threat. Lordaeron's northernmost
                settlements were consumed utterly.
                <br><br>
                As the ranks of the undead swept across Lordaeron, King Terenas's only son, Prince Arthas Menethil, took
                up the fight against the undead. As was the Lich King's intention all along, Arthas succeeded in killing
                Kel'Thuzad, but even so, the undead ranks swelled with every soldier that fell defending the land.
                Frustrated and stymied by the seemingly unstoppable enemy, Arthas took increasingly extreme steps to
                drive them out. He eventually ordered the slaughter of everyone in Stratholme, to prevent Mal'Ganis from
                adding its citizens (most of which had contracted the plague) to his army of the dead. Arthas failed to
                trap Mal'Ganis, who escaped to Northrend.[11] Arthas's comrades warned him that he was losing his hold
                on his humanity.
                <br><br>
                Arthas's fear and resolve proved to be his ultimate undoing. He tracked the plague's source to
                Northrend, intending to end its threat forever by killing its supposed leader Mal'Ganis. He stumbled
                across his long-time friend, Muradin Bronzebeard, brother to the dwarven King Magni, and the dwarf led
                him to a legendary weapon they hoped would help them combat the Scourge. Instead, Prince Arthas himself
                fell prey to the Lich King's tremendous power. Believing that it would help him save his people, Arthas
                took up the cursed runeblade, Frostmourne. Though the sword did grant him great power, the cost was
                high: Muradin lay dead (or so Arthas believed), and Arthas began to lose his soul, transformed into the
                first and greatest of the Lich King's death knights. Arthas finally exacted revenge upon Mal'Ganis,
                removing one of the Lich King's more dangerous jailers and completing the unholy transformation.
                With his soul cast aside and his sanity shattered, Arthas led the Scourge against his own kingdom —
                Lordaeron. Arthas started with the murder of his own father, King Terenas, and crushed Lordaeron with
                his newfound unholy strength.
                <br><br>
                With Arthas as his champion, Ner'zhul spread the plague throughout Lordaeron. What remained of the Order
                of the Silver Hand struck back, but even the mighty Uther fell to the death knight's power. On
                orders from Tichondrius, Arthas took the Scourge north, to the high elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas, to
                resurrect the Summoner of Archimonde — Kel'Thuzad. The high elves never stood a chance, and their
                capital, Silvermoon, was ravaged — their millennia-aged Sunwell was warped and used to resurrect
                Kel'Thuzad as a lich. Thus, both masters were appeased: the Lich King's most loyal worshiper was
                returned, and the Summoner was unleashed.
                <br><br>
                Having progressed too far into the Legion's plan (and guarded too closely by Tichondrius) to back out
                now, Ner'zhul's minions laid siege to Dalaran, reclaiming a spellbook of Medivh, which contained the
                incantations needed for Kel'Thuzad to summon Archimonde.
                <br><br>
                Finally, Archimonde was summoned outside Dalaran, and he immediately gave control of the Scourge to
                Tichondrius and the Dreadlords. But the Lich King was not done yet. Archimonde may have removed
                Ner'zhul's control over the undead, but in his eagerness for vengeance against the night elves, he
                forgot to return the Frozen Throne to Kil'jaeden. Thus, the Lich King remained at large. In fact, it
                seems the Lich King had already anticipated the later defeat of both Archimonde and the Burning Legion
                on Azeroth - Kel'thuzad revealed to Arthas (who was rather baffled by how the Scourge's leadership
                changed so quickly) that the Lich King had foreseen the demotion and that Arthas could still have a part
                to play in his "grand design".
                <br><br>
                During the Legion's invasion of Ashenvale, Illidan Stormrage was released from his barrow prison after
                ten thousand years of captivity. Realizing Illidan's addiction to magic, and having utilized the Skull
                of Gul'dan himself years earlier, the Lich King dispatched Arthas to Kalimdor. There, Arthas covertly
                told Illidan about the powers of the Skull of Gul'dan. Unable to resist such power, Illidan took up the
                skull and harnessed its vast energies. By doing so, Illidan developed demonic features and vastly
                magnified power. Illidan, exactly as the Lich King had planned, then proceeded to kill Tichondrius and
                liberate Felwood.
                <br><br>
                Without Tichondrius's support team, Archimonde's overconfident ascent of Mount Hyjal led to the
                unexpected: his annihilation.

                The Lich King watched the events of Hyjal and when Kil'jaeden reached out to him to continue the war, he
                refused the demon lord.
                <br><br>
                Bristling with power and free to roam the world once more, Illidan set out to find his own place in the
                great scheme of things. However, Kil'jaeden confronted Illidan and made him an offer he could not
                refuse. Kil'jaeden was angered by Archimonde's defeat at Mount Hyjal, but he had greater concerns than
                vengeance. Sensing that his creation, the Lich King, was out of his control, Kil'jaeden ordered Illidan
                to destroy Ner'zhul and put an end to the undead Scourge once and for all. In exchange, Illidan would
                receive untold power and a true place amongst the remaining lords of the Burning Legion.
                <br><br>
                Illidan agreed and immediately set out to destroy the Frozen Throne, the icy crystal cask in which the
                Lich King's spirit resided. Illidan knew that he would need a mighty artifact to destroy the Frozen
                Throne. Using the knowledge he had gained from Gul'dan's memories, Illidan decided to seek out the Tomb
                of Sargeras and claim the Dark Titan's remains. Using his vast, demonic powers, he lured the serpentine
                naga from their dark undersea lairs. Led by the cunning witch Lady Vashj the naga helped Illidan reach
                the Broken Isles, where Sargeras's tomb was rumored to be located. There he found the Eye of Sargeras.
                <br><br>
                Through the undead, the Lich King then noticed the naga and Lady Vashj in the ruins of Dalaran. At first
                he did not understand their presence there, but as Illidan later appeared in the city, he understood
                that Kil'jaeden must have recruited Illidan to destroy him. He was reminded of his own weakness, so he
                sent his Scourge to Dalaran as well. Strengthened by the city's ley energy lines, Illidan used the
                Eye to cast a destructive spell against the Lich King's citadel of Icecrown in distant Northrend.
                Illidan's attack shattered the Lich King's defenses and ruptured the very roof of the world. The Lich
                King had no defense against this spell, and he would have been forever vanquished that day. But at the
                final moment, Illidan's destructive spell was stopped when his brother Malfurion intervened, sensing
                that the spell was causing great damage to the world.
                <br><br>
                Now that Ner'zhul had openly defied the will of the Legion, he knew that the wrath of Kil'jaeden and his
                demonic lackeys would be fierce - and at the worst possible time, Ner'zhul was losing his magical power.
                When he had pushed Frostmourne from the throne, he had caused a crack within the icy cask. Illidan's
                spell had caused this crack to worsen and now the Lich King's powers were rapidly seeping out like blood
                from an open wound. Half-way across Azeroth, residing over the unholy remains of his father's kingdom,
                Arthas was losing power as well — his powers came directly from the Frozen Throne, through his blade
                Frostmourne, and his hold over the undead was also slipping.
                <br><br>
                Ner'zhul knew that his time was short. Imprisoned within the Frozen Throne, he suspected (correctly)
                that Kil'jaeden would send his agents to destroy him. Desperate to save himself, he called his greatest
                mortal servant to his side: the death knight King Arthas.
                <br><br>
                Though his powers were drained by the Lich King's weakness, Arthas had been involved in a civil war in
                Lordaeron. Half of the standing undead forces, led by Sylvanas Windrunner the banshee, had been freed by
                the Lich King's sudden loss of influence and resented what they had become. Also, another group of
                undead was still under the control of the Legion's remaining commanders: the three dreadlords
                Varimathras, Detheroc and Balnazzar. Arthas, called by the Lich King, was forced to leave the
                Scourge in the hands of his lieutenant, Kel'Thuzad, as the war escalated throughout the Plaguelands.
                <br><br>
                Ultimately, Sylvanas and her rebel undead (known as the Forsaken) claimed the ruined capital city of
                Lordaeron as their own. Consuming the old sewers beneath the wrecked Capital City, the Forsaken vowed to
                defeat the Scourge and drive Kel'Thuzad and his minions from the land. The Lich King was powerless to
                stop them.
                <br><br>
                Weakened, but determined to save his master, Arthas reached Northrend only to find Illidan's naga and
                blood elves waiting for him. He and his nerubian allies (in the form of crypt fiends led by the
                fallen spiderlord Anub'arak) raced against Illidan's forces to reach the Icecrown Glacier and defend the
                Frozen Throne.
                <br><br>
                Arthas, with Anub'arak's help, battled his way through their forces until faced with Prince Kael'thas.
                Kael'thas fought with his father's reforged runeblade, Inv sword 1h artifactfelomelorn d 01
                [Felo'melorn]. Flamestrike clashed against Frostmourne, but in the end Arthas forced Kael'thas to flee,
                leaving the path open. He then proceeded to magically activate the four Icecrown obelisks around the
                glacier, opening the doors to the Frozen Throne.
                <br><br>
                However, Illidan was waiting for him. Arthas warned Illidan to leave Azeroth and never return. Illidan
                replied that he had promised Kil'jaeden to destroy the Frozen Throne, which Arthas coldly countered that
                he will never succeed. After a short but intense battle, Illidan inadvertently left himself open and
                Arthas quickly took advantage of it, slicing open the demon hunter's chest. Illidan collapsed,
                grievously wounded. Arthas then turned towards the open doors of Icecrown, leaving Illidan on the ground
                instead of finishing him.
                <br><br>
                Arthas entered the hollow glacier and beheld a winding pinnacle chained to the ice. As he strode up the
                stairs towards his destiny, the voices of those he had forsaken flooded through his mind. First, he
                heard again Uther warning him "If we allow our passions to turn to bloodlust, then we will become as
                vile as the orcs." Then he heard again more angry remarks from Uther and Muradin, as well as his own
                responses to them, yet he ignored them, continuing his ascent. Finally, he reached the pinnacle and
                before him he saw an icy cask, within which was a suit of armor, arranged as if seated on a massive
                throne. Now only two voices spoke to him: Medivh's previous warning to Jaina and the rasping whisper of
                Ner'zhul:
                <br><br>
                "Your young prince will find only death in the cold north."
                <br><br>
                "Return the blade... complete the circle... release me from this prison!"
                <br><br>
                With a great cry of strength, Arthas brought the might of Frostmourne to bear against the Lich King's
                icy prison and with a haunting scream, the Frozen Throne exploded, and shards of the crystal scattered
                on the ground. With Ner'zhul's thorny helm at his feet, Arthas leaned forward, picked it up and then
                placed the unimaginably powerful artifact on his head.
                <br><br>
                "Now," they spoke in unison, "we are one!"
                <br><br>
                In that moment, just as he always planned, Ner'zhul's soul fused with Arthas' into a single mighty
                being. And thus one of the most powerful entities on Azeroth was born.
                <br><br>
                After the merger, he was still telepathically in contact with his minions. One year later, Arthas was
                contacted by Dar'Khan and told about the remaining powers of the Sunwell somewhere in Lordaeron. He
                responded that dragons would be drawn to the energy. He also ordered the lich Amnennar the
                Coldbringer to remain on Kalimdor and expand the Scourge's influence. In Year 25, he gave commands to
                Kel'Thuzad and also he developed a fascination with the notion of Light-wielding warriors who
                invoked their powers without the need for a moral code, and instructed his pawn Dar'Khan Drathir to
                entrap Blood Knights and raise them as undead.
                <br><br>
                The Lich King sat dormant for several years while storms raged across Northrend and his minions
                constructed Icecrown Citadel around the Frozen Throne. While the Lich King dreamt, the various personas
                in his mind - the death knight Arthas Menethil, the orc shaman Ner'zhul, and Matthias Lehner, the
                personification of the remnants of Arthas's humanity - fought for influence and control over the entity.
                <br><br>
                Matthias tried to reason with Arthas, but Arthas silenced him by running him through with Frostmourne.
                Ner'zhul was delighted by this, declaring that he and Arthas were now free to merge into a single
                glorious being. Arthas rejected this offer, stating that once he had the power of the Lich King, no one
                would tell him what to do again. He impaled the stunned Ner'zhul with Frostmourne, becoming the dominant
                personality of the Lich King and ending the dream.

                In his quiet meditation, the part of the Lich King that was Arthas began to reflect on the events of his
                life, on the path that had taken him so far from the young boy who who had been his father's pride and
                joy. In the midst of his reflections, Arthas sensed a bitter and ancient presence locked within the
                nearby ice, and with this realization came the name Sindragosa.
                <br><br>
                When the Lich King awakened, he removed his own heart, believing that anything that made him at all
                mortal made him weak.
                <br><br>
                Afterwards, he journeyed to Sindragosa's Fall where he raised the ancient dragon Sindragosa, the first
                consort to Malygos, as a frost wyrm, then watched his massive undead army prepare for war. His final
                desecration of Sindragosa was to tear the spirits of her lost whelps into undeath in front of her
                skeletal form, as a final affront to the great dragon, and then ordered her to lead the
                Frostbrood into war.
                <br><br>
                While he was sleeping, his death knights trained in Icecrown. After he awoke, he ordered the march on
                Light's Hope Chapel because of the thousand heroes of the Alliance buried there. He wanted to raise them
                and claim those lands for the Scourge.
                <br><br>
                The Lich King also saw fit to bring Arugal back, so his san'layn resurrected him as a shade.
                <br><br>
                The capitals of Azeroth began receiving mysterious packages with infected grain. As their citizens ate
                grain from the infected packages, they were turned into bloodthirsty ghouls if not treated by members of
                the Argent Dawn. With all the major capitals thrown into chaos, necropoleis appeared around the world,
                triggering a second Scourge war. Adventurers from both the Alliance and the Horde fought back the
                disease and the advancing Scourge armies. Outraged by this treachery, Warchief Thrall with his fellow
                Horde leaders, and King Varian Wrynn planned an invasion on Northrend to deal with the Lich King once
                and for all.
                <br><br>
                The final straw occurred when the Lich King directly attacked the capitals of the Horde and the
                Alliance. Orgrimmar and Stormwind were attacked by large Scourge armies consisting of frost wyrms and
                abominations. The Battles for Stormwind and Orgrimmar were won by the brave adventurers and their
                leaders once more, thus forming the Horde Expedition and the Alliance Vanguard.
                <br><br>
                These attacks were intended to lure powerful heroes to Northrend, where the Lich King sought to corrupt
                them and use them against their own people, in a reflection of Arthas's own journey.
                <br><br>
                Not content to just lure the champions of Azeroth into his service, the Lich King decided to remove the
                anti-Scourge presence within the plaguelands. To this end, he created a new order of death knights led
                by Darion Mograine. Accompanied by two Val'kyr Battle-maidens when atop Acherus, and by Prince Keleseth
                and Prince Valanar later, he commanded his forces and successfully forced the Scarlet Crusade from
                Lordaeron, with the survivors becoming the Scarlet Onslaught and heading to Northrend.
                <br><br>
                During the battle, the Lich King sensed an old enemy he destroyed long ago, but he was content to ignore
                that at the time.
                <br><br>
                Empowered by the destruction of the Scarlet Crusade, the Scourge prepared to attack Light's Hope Chapel
                and destroy the Argent Dawn. Despite the odds, the Argent Dawn won against the army of damned, largely
                thanks to the arrival of Tirion Fordring. The spirit of Alexandros Mograine, the original Ashbringer,
                appeared to speak with his defeated son Darion. The Lich King then took to the field himself, sealing
                away Alexandros's soul.
                <br><br>
                Realizing how he had been betrayed, Darion attacks the Lich King, only to be swatted aside. Fordring
                comes forward in preparation to battle the Lich King. The Lich King incapacitates him, stating that
                sacrificing a small army of death knights was a small price to pay to draw Tirion out of hiding. Lord
                Maxwell Tyrosus gives the order to attack, and while the remaining Defenders of the Light charge the
                Lich King, they are easily blasted away.
                <br><br>
                Having heard from the Lich King himself of why he would throw away Darion and the death knights under
                his command, Darion uses Arthas's focus on Tirion against him and throws the Inv sword 2h
                ashbringercorrupt [Corrupted Ashbringer] to Fordring. The combination of Fordring's own faith and the
                holy ground of Light's Hope cleanses the Ashbringer, restoring the sword to its original glory. With
                this new power, Tirion escapes the Lich King's spell and strikes him with the holy sword.
                <br><br>
                Stunned by this turn of events, the Lich King retreats after promising that the next time he meets
                Fordring, it will not be on holy ground.
                <br><br>
                This battle led to the creation of two of the Lich King's greatest enemies: Tirion Fordring's Argent
                Crusade (a combination of the Argent Dawn and Silver Hand) and Darion Mograine's Knights of the Ebon
                Blade (an order of death knights who broke free from the Lich King's control).
