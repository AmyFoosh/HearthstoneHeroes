            <h2>Lore</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Lord Uther the Lightbringer, or Sire Uther Lightbringer, was the first of the five paladins of the
                Knights of the Silver Hand along with Turalyon, Saidan Dathrohan, Tirion Fordring, and Gavinrad the
                Dire. Once a knight of Lordaeron and a follower of the Church of the Holy Light, under the spiritual
                advising of Alonsus Faol, he became the Supreme leader of the Order of the Silver Hand during the Second
                War, and led his brothers in arms against the orcs of the Old Horde. He was held to be the wisest and
                most noble of all the holy paladins.
                <br><br>
                Following the war, Uther and his paladins kept the peace in Lordaeron for years, settling civil disputes
                and quelling demi-human uprisings throughout the realm. A hero of the Alliance of Lordaeron, and a
                faithful ally of King Terenas Menethil II, he became the master of his son Prince Arthas and made him a
                paladin of the order.
                <br><br>
                During the Third War, Uther fought the undead across the Kingdom of Lordaeron and investigated the
                source of the Plague of Undeath. When Arthas ordered the Culling of Stratholme, Uther refused to purge
                the city and its infected citizens and departed with his men to warn the king after the Silver Hand was
                suspended by the prince. During the Scourging of Lordaeron, Uther was betrayed and murdered by his
                beloved pupil, while defending the urn carrying the ashes of Terenas at Andorhal.
                <br><br>
                At the moment of his death, Frostmourne shattered Uther's soul into two fragments, with one being held
                captive inside the mourneblade while another was brought to the Shadowlands plane of Bastion to become
                one of the kyrian, albeit with fragmented memories. Uther played a key role in the rise of the rebel
                Forsworn alongside their leader, Devos, but he later realized the error of his ways. After his memories
                and soul were healed, he led the Forsworn to rejoin the rest of the kyrians and helped the heroes of
                Azeroth to stop Zovaal the Jailer.
                <br><br>
                Prior to the Second War, Uther was an accomplished knight and a devout worshiper of the Holy
                Light since his youth. He was also a student of Alonsus Faol, having met the priest when he was simply a
                bishop of Lordaeron, and the latter served as Uther's spiritual advisor and mentor.
                <br><br>
                When the survivors and refugees from the south emerged in Lordaeron, Uther went to Balnir Farmstead in
                order to get Prince Arthas Menethil, who was watching the birth of his steed Invincible, back to Capital
                City. On their way back, the knight told the prince about the fall of Stormwind and the coming of Prince
                Varian Wrynn and Lord Anduin Lothar at the royal palace.
                <br><br>
                The fall of Stormwind, and the slaughter Brotherhood of Northshire by the orcs, made Faol realize that
                sometimes faith was not enough to combat the evil forces of the world. With Lothar's permission, and the
                aid of Uther, the Archbishop recruited a handful of knights to create a new order that could fight the
                enemy with both the gift of Light and martial prowess. He offered Uther a place among them, as one of
                the five candidates from Lordaeron to start the Order of the Knights of the Silver Hand, along with
                Turalyon, Tirion Fordring, Saidan Dathrohan and Gavinrad the Dire.
                <br><br>
                While traveling with Anduin Lothar's army, Uther and the others were trained vigorously day and night by
                Faol, who taught them how to use the Light to comfort their allies, to smite their enemies and how to
                lead by example, as they would be more than weapons but beacons of hope to guide the Alliance of
                Lordaeron. As their training progressed, Faol presented each of the paladins with enchanted librams that
                were among the church's most ancient relics. Each libram represented a core trait of the Silver Hand
                that Faol challenged his students to become the living embodiment of, and Uther was given the Libram of
                Justice. At the Alonsus Chapel in Stratholme, Uther became the first and Supreme Leader of the new
                order. It was a glorious moment for the Alliance of Lordaeron and believers of the Holy Light. As Lothar
                often checked on the emergent order, he was so pleased by what he saw that he asked for Turalyon and
                Uther to serve as his lieutenants, and the Archbishop was happy to accommodate the supreme commander,
                but he did not release the paladins from his care yet. It would be weeks before Uther and the others
                were ready to set foot on the battlefield.
                <br><br>
                As the Supreme leader of the Silver Hand, Uther participated in some of the bloodiest conflicts of the
                Second War. During the first major battle between the Orcish Horde and the Alliance of Lordaeron, the
                Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills, Uther and his paladins had finished their training and rode through the
                Alliance lines, their presence filling their fellow soldiers with hope and courage. When the death
                knights of Gul'dan entered the field and began to slaughter the Alliance troops, a blazing white light
                appeared from Uther and his holy knights, striking down the reanimated human corpses and sweeping away
                the death knights' corruptive fog. On the battlefield, Uther's command had such presence that his
                knights at times seemed both invincible and unstoppable.
                <br><br>
                Following the end of the battle, Uther embarked on the island of Caer Darrow on a mission to aid and
                comfort those suffering from the war, there he was ambushed by Alteraci pirates. After the naval
                battle, some of the sailors were captured and Uther uncovered a conspiracy that would reveal that
                Alterac had betrayed the Alliance. During questioning in Lordaeron's capital, they confessed their
                nation's treachery to the Alliance, leading to Alterac's eventual ruin.
                <br><br>
                During the liberation of Ironforge and Gnomeregan from Kilrogg Deadeye and his Bleeding Hollow clan,
                Lothar sent Uther and his paladins to Lordaeron, in order to make sure that the region was safe again
                from the orcs. After Uther completely eliminated the orc presence in Lordaeron, he also aided Lothar
                in the final battle of Blackrock Spire. After the Siege of Blackrock Spire, Uther expressed his
                happiness at seeing Turalyon's faith finally emerge, and he was named "Lightbringer" by Turalyon, a
                brother paladin who he had trained and the lieutenant of Anduin Lothar. Against the latter's
                expectation, Uther did nothing against Turalyon's promotion as Supreme Commander of the Alliance of
                Lordaeron, and instead was delighted that it was he who took the place of Lothar. Eventually, the
                Lightbringer led the final assault against the Burning Blade clan at the Dark Portal alongside Turalyon,
                the Azerothian side of the Dark Portal was destroyed, thanks in part to the bravery and skill of Uther
                the Lightbringer and the Order of the Silver Hand.
                <br><br>
                After the Horde's defeat at the end of the Second War, Uther along with Turalyon and the Knights of the
                Silver Hand were stationed in Stormwind City with their main base being the Cathedral of Light. The city
                was still being rebuilt after the First War, and the Cathedral was one of the few places complete. There
                Uther helped the sick, injured, orphaned, old and occasionally helped women give birth. Even Alleria
                shared a tease about the paladins being reduced to 'nurses'.
