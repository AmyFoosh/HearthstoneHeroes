                Lady Jaina Proudmoore is the daughter of Daelin and Katherine Proudmoore, and sister of Derek and
                Tandred. She is considered one of the finest mages in all Azeroth and the most powerful human
                sorceress alive. She is the Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras, the former leader of the Kirin Tor of
                Dalaran, and of the port-city of Theramore.
                <br><br>
                Trained as the personal agent of Archmage Antonidas, the late leader of the Kirin Tor and Dalaran, she
                was sent to investigate the plague of undeath with Prince Arthas Menethil, her childhood friend and
                one-time romantic interest. She witnessed the first stages of the fall of Lordaeron during the Third War
                firsthand and, guided by a mysterious prophet later revealed as Medivh, Jaina rallied what survivors she
                could find and fled across the sea to Kalimdor.
                <br><br>
                There, her expedition forces joined together with the night elves and the New Horde and defeated the
                Burning Legion during the Battle of Mount Hyjal. The human survivors then founded the port city of
                Theramore, joining the Alliance led by Varian Wrynn, while maintaining peace with the Horde for several
                years.
                <br><br>
                Shortly after the fall of Deathwing, the Horde led by Garrosh Hellscream destroyed Theramore. Jaina
                managed to escape with her life, but the experience transformed her, making her more bellicose and even
                altering her appearance. Following the death of Rhonin during the attack, and fulfilling a prophecy made
                by the dragon-mage Korialstrasz, Jaina took the fallen mage's place as leader of the Kirin Tor and head
                of the Council of Six. In spite of personal tragedies, she attempted to maintain the Kirin Tor's
                neutrality during the Alliance-Horde war. After the Horde-aligned Sunreavers aided Garrosh to steal the
                Divine Bell, Jaina exiled the Sunreavers from her city during the Purge of Dalaran and aligned the Kirin
                Tor with the Alliance. Following the Battle for the Broken Shore, the Council decided unanimously to
                re-admit the Horde into Dalaran for the greater good. Furious, Jaina left the Kirin Tor.
                <br><br>
                Following the War of the Thorns, Jaina returned to her homeland of Kul Tiras in the name of the Alliance
                but was imprisoned for treason by her mother at the suggestion of Lady Priscilla Ashvane. After
                Ashvane's own betrayal was discovered, Jaina reconciled with her mother and brought the lost Kul Tiran
                fleet back home. Katherine stepped down as Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras and named Jaina in her stead,
                re-pledging their nation to the Alliance cause and to the Fourth War.
                <br><br>
                After the end of the war, Jaina was captured along other leaders of both factions by the Mawsworn, and
                was sent into the Shadowlands where she was tormented within Torghast. She was eventually rescued by Maw
                Walkers and joined them in their campaign against the Jailer and his forces, with her main focus being
                the rescue of Anduin.
                <br><br>
                Born three years prior to the First War, Jaina Proudmoore was the middle child of Lord Admiral
                Daelin Proudmoore, ruler of Kul Tiras, and his wife Katherine. Jaina was loved by her family and, from
                an early age, was filled with the joy of learning and the duties of a young lady, despite House
                Proudmoore's military background. As a child, she had a governess and several tutors and propriety
                demanded that she be followed by an escort of her lady-in-waiting and a guard or two. She had a
                habit of hiding whenever she was frightened or upset, but her mother Katherine would always find
                her. Jaina had always been fond of reading; the library of Proudmoore Keep was her favorite spot
                growing up as her mother bemusedly noted, "surrounding [herself] with musty old tomes." At a young
                age, she was enamored with tales of the Guardian Aegwynn. As a child, Jaina witnessed a tidesage
                bless a Kul Tiran ship at least once, something she would not see again until many years later.
                Growing up, she also heard tales of the power of the Inv wand 1h kultirasquest b 01 [Abyssal
                Scepter].
                <br><br>
                When her magical talent was discovered after the Second War, Katherine had to fight Daelin to allow
                Jaina to be taught at Dalaran, though their daughter didn't know of this. On her way to Dalaran,
                Jaina—who was then 11 years old—briefly stayed as a guest in Lordaeron's Capital City, where she
                became close friends with Princess Calia Menethil. One day during a prayer session in the Menethil
                family chapel, Jaina for the first time met the 12-year-old Prince Arthas, heir to the throne of
                Lordaeron, who thought Jaina looked like someone who was well accustomed to riding and hiking, spent a
                great deal of time outdoors, and would not mind having a snowball pelted in her face or going for a swim
                on a hot day. Arthas volunteered to escort Jaina to Dalaran along with her guards and servants. One
                night during the journey, the prince convinced her to sneak off with him and look at one of the
                internment camps where the Alliance kept orcs imprisoned—the first real adventure they had together.
                Unlike Arthas, Jaina found herself feeling compassion for the captive orcs, even though the Horde had
                killed her older brother Derek during the Second War.
                <br><br>
                Jaina spent the following years studying as a member of the Kirin Tor in Dalaran. 6 years after her
                arrival to the city, she badgered the Kirin Tor's leader Archmage Antonidas into accepting her as an
                apprentice, eventually becoming one of the few female wizards in direct service to Dalaran. She came
                to be known as a star pupil who excelled at magical research and investigation, and Antonidas
                believed she had the potential to become the greatest sorceress in human history. The high elf
                prince Kael'thas Sunstrider was enamored with Jaina, but she did not return his feelings and remained
                focused on her studies as she wanted to advance on her own merits and not simply because an elven
                prince enjoyed her company.
                <br><br>
                When Jaina was 18, she and her father Daelin attended Prince Arthas' induction into the Knights of the
                Silver Hand in Stormwind City. Shortly after, Arthas visited Dalaran for a few months under the pretense
                of studying history so that he could get an opportunity to court Jaina. During a ride outside the city,
                the two kissed for the first time and began a romantic relationship, much to Kael'thas' chagrin. They
                initially kept their affair secret from the public in order to avoid feeding the rumor mill, but over
                the following year, Jaina began visiting Capital City during holidays. At Hallow's End, after Jaina used
                a fire spell to ignite the wickerman to the crowd's delight, she and Arthas retreated to the prince's
                rooms and had slept together for the first time. Afterward, Jaina promised Arthas that she would never
                deny him. Jaina was subsequently invited to spend the winter in Capital City and began being treated as
                a member of the royal family, as everyone assumed that she and Arthas would marry and have children
                soon. However, during a Winter Veil ball a few weeks after Hallow's End, Arthas began questioning
                whether the two of them were ready to be together and abruptly ended the relationship so that Jaina
                could focus on her magical studies in Dalaran and Arthas could focus on his commitments to Lordaeron.
                Jaina was very hurt by the decision but did not fight him on it, eventually realizing and agreeing that
                it was the right thing to do at the time. Both of them agreed to remain friends. Jaina returned to
                Dalaran, where at one point she helped Antonidas dispose of the renegade wizard Kel'Thuzad's necromantic
                experiments.
