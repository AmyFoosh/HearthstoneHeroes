                Illidan Stormrage, commonly known as the Betrayer, is the first of the demon hunters, the former
                self-proclaimed Lord of Outland, the former ruler of the Black Temple, and the original leader of the
                Illidari. He is the twin brother of Malfurion Stormrage and was, like his sibling, in love with Tyrande
                Whisperwind. Originally a powerful night elf sorcerer, Illidan officially betrayed his people by
                defecting to the demonic Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients, though his reasons for doing so
                were noble as he secretly aimed to repel the Legion's invasion. He eventually returned to the side
                of his fellow night elves, but his creation of a second Well of Eternity at the end of the war caused
                his people to name him "Betrayer" and imprison him in the Barrow Deeps below Mount Hyjal. There he
                remained for over 10,000 years, watched over by the warden Maiev Shadowsong and her Watchers.
                <br><br>
                When the Legion invaded Azeroth once more during the Third War, Tyrande freed Illidan from his prison in
                order to have him battle the demons once more. He subsequently consumed the fel energies of the Skull of
                Gul'dan and transformed into a demon in order to defeat the dreadlord Tichondrius, an act for which he
                was banished by Malfurion. After the Legion's defeat at the end of the war, Illidan decided to feign
                allegiance to the demon lord Kil'jaeden by agreeing to destroy Kil'jaeden's traitorous creation, the
                Lich King, as a way to learn more about his true foe: the Burning Legion.[14] Although he amassed an
                army of servants in the form of the naga led by Lady Vashj, Illidan's efforts were stopped by the night
                elves and he was forced to flee to the shattered realm of Outland. There he and his naga gathered new
                allies in the form of the blood elves led by Kael'thas Sunstrider and the Broken draenei led by Akama,
                and with their aid he overthrew Outland's tyrannical ruler Magtheridon to claim the broken realm for his
                own. Illidan later traveled with his allies to the Lich King's stronghold of Icecrown for one last
                attempt to complete Kil'jaeden's mission, but he was eventually thwarted and nearly killed by the Lich
                King's champion, the death knight Arthas Menethil.
                <br><br>
                Returning to Outland, Illidan dropped all pretense of serving Kil'jaeden and mustered his army—the
                Illidari—to begin his true war against the Burning Legion. He trained an army of elven demon hunters
                in his own image and began preparing to destroy the Legion world of Argus, but his extreme methods and
                single-minded focus on his goal led to the alienation of his allies Kael'thas and Akama. Through the
                manipulations of Kil'jaeden, the Alliance and Horde invaded Outland and began dismantling Illidan's
                forces in the belief that he was no better than the demons he claimed to fight. Despite succeeding in
                destroying the demon stronghold of Nathreza, the Betrayer was ultimately cornered and struck down within
                his own sanctum by Akama, a group of Azerothian adventurers, and his vengeful former jailer, Maiev.
                Maiev subsequently brought Illidan's corpse to the Vault of the Wardens so that his spirit could suffer
                the rest of his eternal sentence. There it remained for years until the Legion invaded once more.
                <br><br>
                A struggle for Illidan's soul ensued between the Legion and the forces of Azeroth, including the
                remaining Illidari, culminating in Illidan's resurrection atop the Nighthold. The Betrayer subsequently
                joined forces with Azeroth's defenders as they battled the Legion across the Broken Shore and within the
                Tomb of Sargeras. During a battle with Kil'jaeden in the Twisting Nether, Illidan used an artifact known
                as the Sargerite Keystone to open a rift that brought the worlds of Azeroth and Argus together. Illidan
                accompanied Azeroth's champions as they traveled to Argus to battle the Legion alongside the Army of the
                Light, whose leader—the prime naaru Xe'ra—believed that Illidan was the Chosen One, a hero of the
                Light prophesied to end the age of demons. Illidan rejected the idea of having his destiny forged
                for him and killed Xe'ra when the naaru tried to forcibly infuse him with the Light. The Army of the
                Light and their allies eventually assaulted Sargeras' seat of power, Antorus, and freed the captive
                spirits of the titan Pantheon, who imprisoned Sargeras at the Seat of the Pantheon for his
                transgressions. While the rest of Azeroth's heroes returned home to their world, Illidan chose to remain
                behind, becoming Sargeras' jailor.
                <br><br>
                Illidan was introduced as a supporting character in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, though he played a far
                more significant role as one of the two main antagonists (alongside Kil'jaeden) in the game's sequel,
                The Frozen Throne. He made his first appearance in World of Warcraft as a major antagonist with the
                first expansion, The Burning Crusade, serving as the final boss of the Black Temple raid in patch 2.1.
                Illidan returned as an anti-hero in World of Warcraft: Legion alongside his Illidari. He became a
                primary force towards defeating the Legion, siding with the heroes of Azeroth.
                <br><br>
                Illidan practiced Highborne magic. In his youth, he attempted to master the druidic forces, as his
                brother had, but the sorcery called to him in a way that the magic of the land did not. Unlike his
                brother, Illidan was born with amber eyes, at the time a sign of a great destiny — however, this
                actually indicated inherent druidic potential.[20] When Malfurion and Tyrande had found their destiny,
                Illidan was still searching for his. Though not a Highborne himself, he became the personal caster of
                the military leader, Kur'talos Ravencrest.
                <br><br>
                When Archimonde's invasion of Azeroth had begun and Azshara's treachery became known, Malfurion
                convinced Illidan to leave his queen. Illidan followed his brother. But as Cenarius and the dragons
                entered the battle, Malfurion came to understand that their adversaries were too powerful to fall in
                combat. To end the invasion, he plotted the destruction of the Well of Eternity. The idea appalled
                Illidan. The Well was the source of his magic — and likely of the elves' immortality — and its loss was
                a price far too dear for him to pay. In addition, the night elf found that he increasingly admired the
                powers of the Burning Legion, seeing a magical purity that underlay their chaotic behavior. Where the
                night elves struggled to maintain their ground, the Burning Legion's numbers did not seem to permanently
                diminish.
                <br><br>
                After the death of Latosius, Illidan became the leader of the Moon Guard. However, Illidan did not use
                the Moon Guard to their fullest potential. Instead of having them cast spells, he ordered them to
                transfer their power into him, thus empowering his own spells instead; but in doing so, this opened them
                to attack from the demons with no means to defend themselves. After one particular battle
                defending Black Rook Hold, where he drained his own soldiers to the point that they died, Illidan
                realized that sacrifice was necessary to defeat the Burning Legion, and the others were fools for not
                seeing it.
                <br><br>
                Illidan had strong feelings for Tyrande Whisperwind, a novice priestess in the Sisters of Elune. Illidan
                so desired to impress Tyrande that he often acted without thinking, particularly in magic; he never
                realized that these displays weren't quite what the priestess was looking for in a mate. But while
                Illidan struggled to win her heart, none of them realized that the battle was over soon after it had
                begun; Tyrande had chosen Malfurion almost from the beginning. Xavius knew of this and used his power to
                darken Illidan's thoughts, convincing him that if Malfurion were to die, Illidan would no longer have a
                rival for Tyrande's love. Finally, the sight of Tyrande in the arms of his brother shattered his final
                ties to the defenders.
                <br><br>
                It was likely somewhere in this point of time that Illidan defeated a doomguard commander named Azzinoth
                and took up the demon's personal weapons as his own; these would become known as the Warglaives of
                Azzinoth. When Illidan left, Kur'talos's daughter Illysanna - distraught over her father's death and
                convinced Illidan's path was right - left to go find him and walk in his footsteps.
