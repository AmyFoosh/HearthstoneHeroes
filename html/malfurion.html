                Malfurion Stormrage was the first mortal druid on Azeroth, and the night elf who
                initiated the mainstream use of druidism among the kaldorei people ten millennia ago under tutelage of
                the demigod Cenarius. He is the twin brother of Illidan Stormrage, as well as the loving and beloved
                husband of the high priestess of Elune, Tyrande Whisperwind. Together, the two have represented the
                highest leadership of the night elves ever since the fall of Queen Azshara and her Highborne caste.
                <br><br>
                Through Malfurion's guidance, the night elves successfully halted the Burning Legion's first invasion of
                Azeroth during the legendary War of the Ancients. In its aftermath, he became the greatest of the
                world's archdruids. Malfurion and his druids slept to protect the Emerald Dream for 10,000 years to
                rebuild the world while his lover Tyrande was promoted to General of the Sentinels and would protect
                Kalimdor. Malfurion and Tyrande then led the night elves in the Third War, defeating the Burning Legion
                as they had done in ages past at the Battle of Mount Hyjal. He subsequently fell into a comatose state
                while in the Emerald Dream.
                <br><br>
                After recovering in the wake of the Cataclysm, Malfurion and Tyrande were wed and now lead their people
                as one. Malfurion is often referred to as Shan'do, which means "honored teacher" in Darnassian.
                Connected deeply to the ebbs and flows of life on Azeroth and bearing ages of responsibility and
                wisdom, he is one of the mightiest and most venerated mortals of the Warcraft
                universe.
                <br><br>
                Malfurion and his twin brother, Illidan, were born at Lorlathil in Val'sharah and grew up in Suramar
                as friends with Tyrande Whisperwind. As a young adult his home was located near a waterfall just outside
                of Suramar, chosen by him because of the tranquility and untouched nature of the falls.
                <br><br>
                Malfurion and Illidan's parents died years before the coming War of the Ancients.
                <br><br>
                Malfurion was the most dedicated of Cenarius' disciples, learning the art of druidism in the forest of
                Val'sharah. Under the tutelage of wise Cenarius, he had become the first mortal druid on Azeroth. In
                the ancient world before the Great Sundering, Malfurion was a respected scholar loyal to his admired
                Queen Azshara. He was among the first to notice the distance Azshara and her followers were keeping from
                their people, and he began to suspect that the powers granted by the Well of Eternity were not as pure
                as all had believed. Though he could not possibly fathom what was soon to come, Malfurion knew that the
                Kaldorei would be forever changed.
                <br><br>
                Azshara and her Highborne were interested in the Well and ordered them to find as much as possible about
                the well. As time passed, the Highborne learned how to draw power from the Well and manipulate its
                energies. Finally, Azshara's reckless use of magic drew the attention of Sargeras, Enemy of All Life and
                Lord of the Burning Legion. By opening a portal in Azshara's palace, Azshara's Highborne sorcerers, led
                by High Lord Counselor Xavius, let hordes of demons into Kalimdor, including the Legion's commanders —
                Archimonde, Mannoroth, and Hakkar the Houndmaster — enabling them to run rampant among the lands and
                striking down all who opposed them. The night elves desperately fought them back, but too many were
                falling to lend them aid. The Burning Legion was winning. The highborne also managed to cast a bigger
                portal over the Well of Eternity to start the summoning of Sargeras.
                <br><br>
                But from the ranks of the desperate Kaldorei rose Malfurion Stormrage. Convincing his twin brother,
                Illidan, to forsake the use of magic, Malfurion and his love, Tyrande Whisperwind, high priestess of
                Elune, quickly went to seek out the demigod Cenarius in the hopes that he might have reprieve for their
                beleaguered people.
                <br><br>
                Even with the help of Cenarius and Alexstrasza the Dragon Queen, Malfurion knew that his people could
                not stand up to the constant barrage of demonic invaders. Believing the Well of Eternity to be their
                gateway, Malfurion decided that it must be destroyed. Knowing that its destruction would render them
                mortal and without any magic, the night elves reluctantly agreed to storm Azshara's stronghold and bring
                an end to the invasion.
                <br><br>
                However, Illidan, spurred by his addiction to magic and his frustrated love for Tyrande, refused to give
                up his power, and left their resistance to warn the Highborne. Knowing that Illidan would quickly reach
                them, Malfurion attacked immediately to retain some surprise.
                <br><br>
                Azshara and her highborne were prepared for them, and her chaotic magics ripped Malfurion's forces to
                shreds. But it was the sight of Tyrande falling to the hands of Azshara's former Highborne, now
                transformed into satyrs that gave Malfurion the strength for one final strike.
                <br><br>
                Azshara's battle with Malfurion threw the portal out of its magical alignment, and the vortex grew
                unstable. Malfurion cast a spell to create a gigantic gale that would rip all the demons from the ground
                and send them on a one-way trip into the Well and to the Twisting Nether. The Well of Eternity then
                started to collapse on itself, pulling land, Azshara's palace and the ruined city of Zin-Azshari into
                itself. Although Sargeras knew that the portal was closing, he tried to do the unthinkable - step into
                the portal to recreate it and enter Azeroth. The portal finally collapsed and trapped Sargeras in it.
                The Well of Eternity exploded in a catastrophic eruption that left the world sundered forever.
                <br><br>
                However, Malfurion survived. Constructing crude rafts and sailing to what would become Kalimdor,
                Malfurion, Tyrande, and Cenarius agreed to lead their people to a new home.
                <br><br>
                To their horror, however, a lake atop Mount Hyjal had become fouled by the magical energies of the Well
                of Eternity, which they had hoped was gone forever. Illidan, who had sought to preserve the arcane magic
                he was addicted to, had taken seven vials of the Well's waters and poured three of them into the lake,
                creating a new Well of Eternity. Knowing that Illidan's addiction to magic would always be a threat to
                the safety of the world, Malfurion imprisoned his brother in the caverns below Hyjal; the Barrow Deeps.
                However, with the Sundering still fresh in their minds, Malfurion and the night elves dared not attempt
                to destroy the new Well. Malfurion would later note that sometimes he went to visit Illidan in his
                prison in the hopes of turning him from his fatal path.
                <br><br>
                Seeking the counsel of the Aspects, Malfurion requested the presence of Alexstrasza, Ysera, and
                Nozdormu, returned from their hiding places, and they were shocked to hear of the new Well. All of them
                suspected that the Burning Legion would sniff out its energies once again and find Azeroth a second
                time.
                <br><br>
                Malfurion agreed, and they all decided to safeguard this Well. To this end, they created the World Tree,
                Nordrassil, which they pledged to use to protect the Well of Eternity and the night elves themselves.
                Alexstrasza, the Life-Binder, grew the tree herself from an enchanted acorn of G'Hanir. Nozdormu, the
                Timeless, placed an enchantment upon the tree: for as long as it stood, the night elves would never die
                of old age or sickness. Ysera, the Dreamer, linked Nordrassil to the Emerald Dream. Through the tree,
                she would slowly rebuild the world. However, to maintain the Emerald Dream, she needed consciousnesses
                to roam its eternal pathways. To sustain it, all the druids agreed to sleep for centuries at a time,
                despite the years they would lose, and be linked to the Emerald Dream forever.
                <br><br>
                Malfurion and Tyrande helped their people rebuild their society amongst the forests of Ashenvale
                surrounding Hyjal. Cenarius taught them the ways of the wood, and Malfurion grew considerably in power
                as he learned the art of the druid, and he became a great Archdruid, first among his people.
                <br><br>
                Though he dearly wished to remain with Tyrande, Malfurion and his druid kindred slept peacefully for
                many years until they were awakened by an attack by Dath'Remar and the Highborne survivors. He was
                quickly routed, but the druids refused to destroy them with so many lives already lost, so Malfurion
                decided that the Highborne were to be exiled. Dath'remar and his followers would later become the high
                elves. Though it pained his heart beyond belief, Malfurion left Tyrande to rejoin the Emerald Dream,
                settling into his long sleep in Malfurion's Barrow Den in Moonglade.
                <br><br>
                At times, it is hinted that Malfurion and the other druids were asleep for all ten millennia between the
                War of the Ancients and the Third War, awakening only in times of great peril. However, most sources
                agree that there was a cycle, and that the druids would awaken every few centuries to interact with
                their wives, sisters, and daughters. This cycle could be easily interrupted if needed, but the druids
                must return to the Dream at the earliest opportunity.
