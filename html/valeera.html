            <h2>Lore</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Valeera Sanguinar, along with Broll Bearmantle, was a companion of Varian Wrynn. She eventually became
                an enforcer for the New Council of Tirisfal and accepted the position of an advisor and bodyguard to
                Varian in Stormwind, with the caveat that she retain her independence.
                <br><br>
                She culturally identifies as a blood elf, taking pride in her people's traditions and defending their
                tribulations and loyalties. However, she herself acts independently of the Thalassian government, and
                has formally joined neither the Horde nor the Alliance since her introduction but is fiercely loyal to
                Varian and his son Anduin.
                <br><br>
                Valeera herself maintains that her loyalties are personal, to her friends and her ideals.
                <br><br>
                When Valeera was young, her family was killed by bandits. She survived both the bandits and the Scourge,
                eking out a living by stealing what she needed. One time, she stole a scroll to find that it contained
                information on her own family: her ancestor Relfthra was a high elf mage and member of the secret Order
                of Tirisfal. However, one day when trying to steal a shaman's talisman, she was caught and jailed.
                Showing her fighting prowess by injuring several of the guards in the process, it's possible that is how
                she attracted the attention of the Arena promoter. The day before she was to implement her escape plan,
                Valeera was sold to Rehgar Earthfury so she could join Bloodeye Redfist and Broll Bearmantle in team
                combat in the Crimson Ring. Soon after, Bloodeye was killed and Broll told Valeera the stories of both
                Rehgar and Bloodeye.
                <br><br>
                After Bloodeye's funeral pyre, Valeera and Broll were being transported in a caged wagon to Orgrimmar to
                be trained as gladiators. On their way, they were joined by a human who had washed up on the seashore
                with no memory. When they reached Orgrimmar, they were caged once again; the human who did nothing but
                brood, while the two elves argued.
                <br><br>
                That evening in the cages, Broll offered the human a meditation remedy, and the man had a brief flash of
                memory. The meditation was interrupted by Valeera, which nearly caused her and Broll to come to blows.
                Valeera, Broll, and the amnesiac human trained in the ways of the gladiator in the Ring of Valor and
                learned to look out for one another, since rival gladiators would test their mettle against the novice
                team in fights to the death while their trainers would gamble on the outcomes. Eventually the three
                traveled to Dire Maul in Feralas where the gladiatorial contests took place. After many bloody battles,
                they emerged the victors of the Crimson Ring tournament. Impressed by Varian's skill at arms, the crowd
                gave him the orcish moniker Lo'Gosh; which means "Ghost Wolf".
                <br><br>
                After winning the Dire Maul gladiatorial contests, Rehgar sold Valeera to Helka Grimtotem, a gladiator
                mistress, for 2000 gold. Helka wanted Valeera to lead an all-female gladiator team consisting of an orc
                and a troll. However, soon after they set out for an exhibition game on the Merchant Coast, Valeera
                escaped with the wyvern Bristlefur. Valeera then went searching for Broll and Lo'Gosh, who had escaped
                from Rehgar Earthfury. As she followed them, she discovered that an assassin was also trailing
                them. She eventually caught up with the assassin and, after catching him off guard, killed him with
                the help of some local beasts. Worn out from the fight, she was rescued by Aegwynn who saw great things
                in her.
                <br><br>
                Aegwynn reunited her with Broll and Lo'Gosh, who was revealed to be the lost king of Stormwind, Varian
                Wrynn. The three were determined to stay together and set out for Stormwind City to return Varian to his
                rightful throne. During the trip across the Great Sea, Valeera helped Varian and Broll defend the ship
                against attacking naga, but during the fight she absorbed the arcane energies of a Naga sea witch's
                trident; this act was what started her addiction to mana.
                <br><br>
                After she arrived at Menethil Harbor, she, Varian, Broll, and a dwarf called Thargas Anvilmar started
                the journey towards Ironforge. On their way they were stopped by Vendellin Soulfire, a blood elf
                warlock sent to assassinate Varian. He placed the mark of Kathra'natir upon Valeera and by doing so
                caused the demon Kathra'natir to possess her.
                <br><br>
                Because she was infected with the fel energies of a demon, her addiction was exacerbated. During
                Valeera's lapses of self control, the demon would occasionally gain influence and take control of her
                body. When the group got to Ironforge, Lo'Gosh and Magni conversed and were secretly being followed by a
                bearded man. Valeera sensed arcane energy being manipulated and witnessed the man creating a dagger with
                the intent to kill Lo'Gosh. Valeera quickly subdued the man, but he transformed into a black dragon and
                fled. She was left behind in Ironforge to adjust from her withdrawal from magic while the rest of her
                companions embarked on a mission to rescue Marshal Windsor. Secluded in her room, the demon tried to
                take control of her body by feeding her feelings of abandonment, using visions of her deceased parents
                to verbally abuse her. Valeera regained control of her senses when a vision of Aegwynn told her she was
                not alone and that she had people like Broll and Varian who loved her. She later rendezvoused with
                Varian and Broll after their mission, informing them that she was better and in control of herself
                again.
                <br><br>
                When the group got to Stormwind City, she helped reveal Onyxia's treachery and traveled with King Varian
                back across the sea to finally kill her. After Onyxia's death, Varian offered both Broll and Valeera
                a permanent place in Stormwind, in which they could act as Varian's bodyguards and advisers. Valeera
                and Anduin convinced Varian that he should create peace between the Horde and the Alliance, but when the
                peace summit was about to happen, Broll was summoned to Darnassus, which saddened Valeera. Aegwynn
                cheered her up, telling her that she has talents but also burdens and responsibilities. During the
                summit, Theramore was attacked by the Twilight's Hammer cult. Although the Twilight Hammer's attack was
                repelled; the peace summit was ruined and both the Horde and Alliance were left in distrust of one
                another.
                <br><br>
                When the Scourge attacked Stormwind, Valeera stayed in Theramore to investigate the perpetrators of the
                ambush. Valeera made a deal with Garona to rescue her son Med'an in exchange for her cooperation in
                revealing the identities of her masters. She later partnered with Meryl Winterstorm and traveled with
                him to Ahn'Qiraj to save Med'an. They found Med'an hanging on the dead body of the old god C'Thun and
                rescued him. However, before they could get away from the ruins of Ahn'Qiraj, they were intercepted by
                Cho'gall who fell Meryl with one strike. Valeera absorbed some magic from Meryl and Med'an in order to
                grow strong enough to fend off Cho'gall, giving Med'an, who had just regained consciousness, enough time
                to heal Meryl. Cho'gall was still too powerful to defeat and, becoming desperate to stay alive, Valeera
                offered herself willingly to the demon inside her in order to use the demon's power to fend off
                Cho'gall. When Meryl regained consciousness, he teleported them all away from Cho'gall. When they
                reached a secure location, Valeera, still possessed by Kathra'natir, lusted over Med'an's power and
                tried to possess him but Med'an was able to reject Kathra'natir's advances. Meryl, who alongside the
                Council of Tirisfal had banished Kathra'natir thousands of years ago, challenged the demon to possess
                his powerful magical body instead in order to lure the demon away from Valeera's body. As the demon
                tried to possess him, Meryl proved himself the stronger of the two wills and repressed the demon within
                his body. Meryl then asked Med'an and Valeera to never tell anyone about what happened between him and
                the demon.
                <br><br>
                She later aided the New Council of Tirisfal with recruiting new members, defending Theramore and aiding
                Med'an and Garona in battling Cho'gall. She was last seen at the funeral of Aegwynn. She returned to
                Stormwind City and remained there until around the time of the Lich King's death.
