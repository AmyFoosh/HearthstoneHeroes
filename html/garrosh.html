            <h2>Lore</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Garrosh Hellscream was a former Warchief of the Horde chosen by Thrall to replace him in the wake of the
                Cataclysm, until he was succeeded by Vol'jin after the Siege of Orgrimmar. Throughout the history of
                Azeroth, few mortals have achieved greater notoriety than him.
                <br><br>
                Garrosh grew up on Draenor in the shadow of his father, the great warrior Grommash Hellscream, leader of
                the Warsong clan. Grom was the first orc leader to drink the blood of Mannoroth, subjugating the orcs to
                the Legion's will. Before this event, Garrosh was among several orcs who had become ill with the red
                pox. They had been quarantined far away in Nagrand, allowing them to escape the demonic corruption. The
                younger Hellscream was ashamed of his father for many years until he met Thrall during the invasion of
                Outland and learned of Grom's heroic redemption. Garrosh has since embraced his potential as a strong
                leader, most notably in Northrend, where he directed the Horde advance through the Borean Tundra and won
                the hearts of his people. Uncompromising and fiercely proud, Garrosh intended to restore the orcs' glory
                by any means necessary.
                <br><br>
                As the renewed Alliance-Horde war developed, Garrosh's thirst for power corrupted him to the point that
                he did not care about the means used to bring the orcish supremacy on Azeroth, with himself as the
                world's supreme ruler - going as far as to unleash the full power of the dead Old God's heart by
                resurrecting it using the Pools of Power, effectively destroying half of the sacred pandaren Vale of
                Eternal Blossoms.
                <br><br>
                Ultimately, he became the final antagonist of Mists of Pandaria's Alliance-Horde war arc. He was
                ultimately defeated and depowered and then captured by the coalition below Orgrimmar. He was to be tried
                in Pandaria as a war criminal, but managed to escape to an alternate Draenor through the efforts of
                Kairoz, and Garrosh's own loyalists aided by the infinite dragonflight. There, he was able to confront
                Gul'dan and witness his transformation into one of the first green orcs, corrupted by the influence of
                the fel powers, and slowly change the course of events leading to the birth of the Iron Horde.
                <br><br>
                In Warlords of Draenor, Garrosh set things in motion. Thanks to his connections with the Blackfuse
                Company who supplied him during the Siege of Orgrimmar, he supplied the orcish clans of Draenor with all
                the technology they required to build their war machines, and he influenced alternate Grommash to unite
                all orcish clans under one banner and reject the blood of Mannoroth. Garrosh also managed to give an
                idea to create a gateway between the alternate timeline and the main one in order to return to exact his
                vengeance on Azeroth, in a form of the Iron Horde's Dark Portal within Tanaan Jungle, using the leaders
                of the Shadow Council as the portal's power source and then sent the Iron Horde in order to conquer the
                world, as well as entrusted Warlord Zaela to arm the Iron star within Blackrock Mountain in order to
                annihilate Stormwind City. He could later be found as the warlord of the Warsong clan in Nagrand where
                he was eventually defeated and killed by Thrall in a mak'gora. Following his death, Garrosh's soul was
                confined to the realm of Revendreth and later the Maw for his sins. However, he remained unrepentant for
                his actions to the last and ultimately chose to destroy himself rather than submit.
                <br><br>
                Garrosh was one of the main characters in The Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, and Cataclysm. He
                later becomes more antagonistic, serving as the main antagonist of Mists of Pandaria and the supporting
                antagonist in Warlords of Draenor.
                <br><br>
                Garrosh was the son of Grommash Hellscream and Golka of the Warsong clan, born on Draenor. At some
                point, young Garrosh was sent to live in Garadar after he contracted the red pox. While the orcs of
                Garadar proudly took the name Mag'har, "uncorrupted" in orcish tongue, Garrosh was tormented by tales of
                his father. He feared that he, too, would lead the Mag'har down a dark path.
                <br><br>
                During the human invasion of Draenor, many Mag'har - the uncorrupted orcs who settled in Garadar, a
                stronghold in Nagrand - were ill due to the red pox. Garrosh was among them.
                <br><br>
                Kargath Bladefist visited them at Garadar in search of warriors to aid him. Garrosh asked him about his
                father, and wanted to fight with him, but Kargath ignored him at first, calling the Mag'har weaklings
                and not orcs any more, and they could do the Horde a favor by dying.[13] Later on Garrosh asked
                Greatmother Geyah about his father, but the answer caused him to enter a deep depression.
                <br><br>
                Garrosh eventually rose to become an important chief among the Mag'har. He was aided by Jorin Deadeye,
                son of the Bleeding Hollow clan's former chieftain, Kilrogg Deadeye. When Horde heroes first met
                Garrosh, he was sullen, pessimistic, even depressed. He was worried about the health of his
                clan's matriarch, Greatmother Geyah, who was ill. Garrosh knew that when she died, he would be expected
                to lead the Mag'har, and that troubled him as well. Garrosh believed himself fated to repeat his
                father's mistakes.
                <br><br>
                Garrosh admitted that he was ashamed of his father. The last news Garrosh had of his father was that
                Grom had drunk Mannoroth's blood, and everything that transpired after this event was unknown to Garrosh
                for a long time. Indeed, Garrosh did not learn of his father's heroic death until Thrall arrived in
                Nagrand and re-enacted the events for Garrosh's benefit. Learning that his father had eventually
                overcome his weakness for power. Grom gave his life so that the orcs would be free of demonic influence
                Garrosh appeared to gain power and confidence, believing he is no longer fated to fail himself and his
                people.
                <br><br>
                Thrall saw much potential in Garrosh. While he was brash and quick to anger, Thrall thought that his
                knowledge of orcish culture and fierce pride could serve the Horde well. He convinced him to leave
                Garadar and become one of his advisors.
